We created one in class by copying the functions we wrote in a notebook into a separate file using the text editor built into Jupyter. There are many possible text editors you could use. And we discussed the specific structure of `.py` files in the lecture. Take a look now at the file we wrote in class that is in `Notebooks/debruijn_funcs.py`. Similarly, you can take a look at the file `Notebooks/eulerian.py`. Our file `debruijn_funcs.py` defines several functions, while the file `eulerian.py` defines several functions in addition to a few Class objects, which we'll discuss below and were covered in your reading. Both of these are valid `.py` files. Because of this, we can use `import` on either of them to gain access to their Classes and functions here in this notebook. So let's try that below. This is called a 'local import' because we are importing these files from our current directory (`Notebooks/`). We'll cover later how to make them importable from anywhere. "

This is the function that is automatically executed when an object of this class is created. Here we can see that the `__init__()` function takes one required argument (target_length) and one optional argument (random_seed). The second argument is optional because there is a default value entered for it in the function arguments (random_seed=123). \n",

The `_random_sequence` function is copied from the `debruijn_funcs` scripts, but is modified slightly. Here, instead of having a `return` statement to return the value, it instead *stores its results to the target attribute of self*. To make `_random_sequence` a function of self, we need to add `self` as the first argument to its function. This is simply the syntax of how to define Class functions. We've also added the function call `random.seed` to initialize the random number generator using the `random_seed` variable. This will make our analyses reproducible. "

Again, the functions here are being taken from the debruijn funcs we wrote before, and just modified slightly.

And, once again, instead of having a return value it stores its results directly to the `self.reads` attribute. "
